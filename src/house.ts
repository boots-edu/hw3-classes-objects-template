/**
 * # Part 2) House
 * You should complete this file AFTER person.ts!
 * 
 * 2.1. Create a class named `House` that has two string fields: `owner` (Person) and `address` (string).
 * 2.2. Create a House constructor that takes in two parameters (owner and address), and assigns them to the appropriate field.
 *      The owner should be a Person object, so you will need to import the class.
 * 2.3. Create a function named `buyHouses` that takes a Person object and an array of strings (addresses), and returns an
 *      array of new House objects.
 *      The owner of each house should be the given Person object, and the addresses should be the given array of strings.
 * 2.4. Create a function named `findByOwner` that takes in an array of `House` objects and a string parameter (ownerName) and 
 *      returns an array of `House` objects and a string parameter (owner) and returns an array of `House` objects that have the given owner.
 *      The house's owner's name should be the first name plus the last name, separated by a space.
