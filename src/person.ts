/**
 * # Part 1) Person
 * We recommend you complete this part first!
 * 
 * Note that you will need to define and export the class and all the functions in this file, before you can
 * run the unit tests. Write "stubs" for the functions before you try to implement them (just the header and a
 * basic return statement, returning a suitable "dummy" value, such as 0 or ""). This will allow you to run the
 * tests and see which functions are being called, and what they are returning.
 * 
 * 1.1 Create a class named `Person` that has three fields: `firstName` (string), `lastName` (string), and `age` (number).
 * 1.2. Create a Person constructor that takes in three parameters (firstName, lastName, age) and assigns them to the appropriate fields.
 * 1.3. Create a function named `averageAge` that consumes an array of Person objects and returns their average age. 
 *       If the array is empty, return 0.
 * 1.4. Create a function named `getFullNames` that consumes an array of Person objects and returns a newline ("\n") separated string 
 *      in the format "firstName lastName". Hint: look up the join method for arrays.
 * 1.5. Create a function named `youngestPerson` that consumes an array of Person objects and returns the name of the youngest person.
 *      If there is a tie, return the name of the first youngest person.
 *      If the array is empty, return an empty string.
 *      Make sure you return both parts of their name separated by a space.
