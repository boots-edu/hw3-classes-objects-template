/**
 * # Part 4) Pixel
 * Do this file last. If you haven't started yet, go back to person.ts.
 * 
 * 4.1. Create a class named `Pixel` that has three number fields: `red`, `green`, and `blue`.
 * 4.2. Create a Pixel constructor that takes in three parameters (red, green, blue) and assigns them to the appropriate fields.
 *      If any of the parameters are less than 0, set the field to 0. If any of the parameters are greater than 255, set the field to 255.
 * 4.3. Create a function named `countPixels` that consumes a 2D array of Pixel objects, and returns how many there are.
 * 4.4. Create a function named `averagePixel` that consumes a 2D array of Pixel objects and returns a new Pixel object that is the average of all the pixels.
 *      If the array is empty, return a new Pixel object with all fields set to 0.
 * 4.5. Create a function named `isRed` that consumes a 2D array of Pixel objects and returns true if all pixels are red (red > green and red > blue).
 *      If the array is empty, return true.
